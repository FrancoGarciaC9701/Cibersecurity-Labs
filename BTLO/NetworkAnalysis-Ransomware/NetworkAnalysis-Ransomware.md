. Wireshark
# üöÄ Conclusion

# üîé Steps
1. Dowload the lab file
2. Unzip the file and the other file if required
3. In this case, we will analyze traffic with Wireshark
4. Answer the questions one by one

# Questions
a. What is the operating system of the host from which the network traffic was captured? 

b. What is the full URL from which the ransomware executable was downloaded? 

c. Name the ransomware executable file? 

d. What is the MD5 hash of the ransomware? 

e. What is the name of the ransomware? 

f. What is the encryption algorithm used by the ransomware, according to the ransom note? 

g. What is the domain beginning with ‚Äòd‚Äô that is related to ransomware traffic? 

h. Decrypt the Tender document and submit the flag

# ‚ùì Question (A) What is the operating system of the host from which the network traffic was captured? 

We go to the statistics section > Capture File Properties, under capture in OS

‚úÖ The Answer is: 32-bit Windows 7 Service Pack 1, build 7601

# ‚ùì Question (B) What is the full URL from which the ransomware executable was downloaded? 

We go to the Wireshark search engine and filter by http.request because with this query we are asking to see the complete URL from where the ransomware was downloaded.

Within the file that the query gave us, in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol section it gives us the full request in violet

‚úÖ The Answer is: http://10.0.2.15:8000/safecrypt.exe

# ‚ùì Question (C) Name the ransomware executable file?

At the end of the URL we can see the name of the executable ending in .exe

‚úÖ The Answer is: safecrypt.exe
